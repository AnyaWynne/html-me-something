                    Practical and creative I love problem solving and working with other people.  
                     I have a BFA with emphasis in Graphic Design and years of experience in print design and 
                    photography. Currently I am learning Front End Web Development. I believe my previous 
                    education and work experience will compliment my newly learned skills.

                         <p>I've worked for many years as a print graphic designer. The benefit of working 
                             in a small department is that I was able to oversee every aspect of design 
                             production from concept to print. Most of my responsibilities included working 
                             on marketing mailâ€‘in material like catalogs and promotional mail pieces, email blasts and 
                             updating information on the company's website.

                         <p>A few years ago my husband and I ran our own wedding photography studio. 
                             I've enjoyed every aspect of wedding photography: meeting with clients, 
                             taking photos of the most important moments of peoples lives, enhancing 
                             the photographs and finally designing wedding albums.  As a small business 
                             owner I've had many responsibilities and learned how to be flexible and 
                             to think of a big picture.

<h3> About me</h3>
