            <header> <h1>Anya Wynne</h1> 
                <p> Practical and creative I love problem solving and working with other people.  
                    I have years of experience in print design and photography.  
                    Currently I am working on learning Front End Web Development. 
                I believe my previous education and work experience will compliment my newly learned skills.
            My goal is to get a job in front end web development at the end of the CoderGirl program.</p>

                         <p>I've worked for many years as a print graphic designer.  
                             The benefit of working in a small department is that I was 
                             able to oversee every aspect of design production from concept to 
                             print.  Most of my responsiilities included working on marketing mail&#8209in 
                             material like catalogs and promotional mail pieces.
                         </p>

                         <p>A few years ago my husband and I ran our own wedding photography studio. I've enjoyed every aspect of 
                             wedding photography: meeting with clients, taking photos of the most important moments of peoples 
                             lives, enhancing the photographs and finally designing wedding albums.
